        <p class="paragraph">
          Syncing files to a desktop connection proves to be problematic and is entirely a time taking process 
          especially going through a lot of protocols to complete a single authorization request. Not only this
           creates ambiguity in a tethered connection but also lacks in proving access to mobile based 
           applications via web-based integration. A solution could be, by the development of a system to 
           provide a credible tethered connection via web-based integration.

          <h2 class="subtitle">NOTABLE FEATURES:</h2>
          <h4>1. Simple UI:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            The problem with syncing apps or remote access apps is that they use
            it with pc control system, as it is a lengthy process to
            save your files over a network. So there should be a simple web app which
            can be accessed from anywhere and it should be as simple as possible
            to copy/paste/sync apps over there.

          <p class="paragraph">

            account.

        <div class="feature">
          <h4>3. Seperable Folders:</h4>
          <p class="paragraph">
            One of the biggest feature we are gonna acheive through this app is
            to handle applications separately independent to each other.

          <h4>4. Future:</h4>

            In future this project can be extended into a to both Android/OS for using applications
            on cross platforms.
